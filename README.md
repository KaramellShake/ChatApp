First of all. You should download MSSQL, and you should create a new database with a table, which includes 3 columns. A UserID (PRIMARY KEY), a UserName, and a Password! When you're open the program, it will open the server for TCP, and the login/register window!

Register an account, and log in! Then, this window will close, and the chat app appears. So now you'll be able to chat with all your friends!
